// This file used to contain an `Item` model but the model was renamed to `Word` and moved to `Word.swift`.
// Item.swift is intentionally left as a placeholder to avoid accidental duplicate model definitions.
// You can safely delete this file if you prefer, but keep in mind `Word.swift` contains the active SwiftData model.
